### Abstract
In current difficult economic circumstances, it is projected that sales of used cars would increase. Increase in the used automobile market, mostly because of a scarcity of silicon. As a result, accurate price predictions of used automobiles is in the best interests of both customers and financiers. Our goal is to propose an intelligent and effective model based on a regression algorithm to anticipate the resale value of a car.

## Project Objectives
- To collect dataset relevant to car resale value
- To Pre-process said data
- To Identify the best regression model
- To Train the model on preprocessed data
- To host model on IBM watson
- To integrate model API and build a flask web-app
